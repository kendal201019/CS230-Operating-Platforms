# CS230-Operating-Platforms

•	Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
o	The Gaming Rooms is a client who is looking to expand their Draw it or Lose It game to additional platforms. They would like us to help develop a web-based version of this game that will operate on multiple platforms. 

•	What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
o	What I did well was to determine the needs of the customer and providing recommendations on how best to meet them. 

•	What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
o	The template of the document makes it very easy to determine what the requirements are, highlight the constraints, and helps in developing the required recommendations needed. 

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
o	I would work on the evaluation aspect of the document. As I gain more experience and do more research on these subjects, I will be able to include more insight. 

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
o	To interpret the needs, we first listened to the customer to see exactly what it is that they wanted to achieve. To implement them into our design we first needed to address constraints. We needed to evaluate the needs and requirements of the game and determine if they could be met, and if we could overcome the constraints. If plausible, we would then determine the software and hardware requirements, determine the platforms we could use, and then make recommendations on how to best approach these needs. 
 
•	How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
o	I used object-oriented designs and the software design template. I would use the same strategies highlighted above. Listening to requirements, determined if they could be met, determining what resources are required to meet the needs, and lasty coming up with a recommendation of how to best approach the question in hand.
